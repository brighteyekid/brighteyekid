Here’s a **cool and technical GitHub profile README** inspired by *Watch Dogs* and *Mr. Robot*. I’ll incorporate hacking, cybersecurity terms, and references to make it feel like you're part of DedSec or Fsociety! 😎

### 🔍 **"Hello, friend.**" 🐍

👾 **Welcome to my digital footprint.**  
I'm a tech-savvy disruptor, CTF hunter, and a terminal-obsessed `cybersecurity student`. Inspired by DedSec and Fsociety, I live between `0s` and `1s`. Whether it’s pentesting a network, scripting exploits, or debugging kernels—there’s always a trace left behind.

## 🛠️ **Operating Systems & Tools**  
```plaintext
> Terminal:   bash/zsh | tmux | neovim
> OS:         Linux (Ubuntu) | Kali Linux
> Scripting:  TypeScript | Python | Bash
> Frameworks: React | Express.js | Spring Boot
> Pentesting: Nmap | Burp Suite | Wireshark | Metasploit | Aircrack-ng
> Hardware:   ESP32 | Arduino | IoT Devices
```

## 🦾 **What I’m Currently Exploiting 🔧**  
- 🕵️ Researching IoT exploitation techniques.  
- 🐍 Building **DeviceGhost** — a network-based red team tool.  
- 🎯 Playing **Hack The Box** (because boxes don’t crack themselves!).  
- ⚙️ Contributing to Open Source `TypeScript` projects.

---

## 🎯 **Core Objectives**  
- 💡 **Code and Break.** Every script has a flaw; every system has a door.  
- 🔐 Pursuing *cyber defense* and *ethical hacking*.  
- 🚀 Automating exploits and leveraging AI/ML for R&D (next-gen tools).

## 📡 **Signal Flow**  
- 🛰️ [GitHub Activity Feed](https://github.com/brighteyekid)  
- 🔗 Find me in **/dev/null** when not coding or pwning boxes.  

---

## 🎭 **Aliases**  
- 💻 Known as "Fox" 🦊 among Linux enthusiasts.  
- ☠️ **Error Code 418**: *"I’m a teapot"*  
- 🐉 **Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+H** (Hack the Planet).

## 🕹️ **Fun Fact:**  
- 📺 I once made my ESP32 blink an LED in `morse code` as “Fsociety Rules.”
