👾 **Welcome to my digital domain.**  
I'm a `cybersecurity enthusiast`, `code conjurer`, and `CTF gladiator`. Fueled by the spirit of DedSec and Fsociety, I dwell in the matrix of `0s` and `1s`. Whether it's breaching firewalls, scripting exploits, or bending an IoT device to my will—every byte tells a story, and every system leaves a trail.
